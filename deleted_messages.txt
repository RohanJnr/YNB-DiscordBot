and donâ€™t forget, with more platforms on top of eachother, the efficiency will take a huge plunge after a certain amount of new platforms. design looks good tho

**From: TechnoCat__#5785**
I hate now hopper minecarts

**From: TechnoCat__#5785**
And its fuckn irritatent to build 1 tower

**From: TechnoCat__#5785**
It is but i think i will just let it om 17 layers and only 1 gold farm and the 17 layers is the perfect amount of layers because adidding more doesnâ€™t increase the gold production because of mob cap

**From: SkyBoiAidan#3866**
fuckn smart brain this shite

**From: SkyBoiAidan#3866**
who needs the xp when you can shorten the design while also increasing spawn rates as long as itâ€™s in the spawn radius

**From: TechnoCat__#5785**
Only the bad thing the xp form of the farm doesnâ€™t work

**From: SkyBoiAidan#3866**
you know itâ€™s the smartest decision

**From: SkyBoiAidan#3866**
